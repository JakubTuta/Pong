# SIMPLE PONG GAME

This project is a simple clone of the classic Pong game, where there are 2 players on each side with a ball floating on the map. The goal for both players is to score 10 points, before the opponent does.

## Controls

Left player: use "W" or "S" \
Right player: use "Arrow up" or "Arrow down"

## How to start

Clone the repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/JakubTuta/Pong
```

Install necessary modules:

```
pip install -r modules.txt
```

Now you can either run the main.py file to get the GUI with all options

```
python main.py
```

or run any file separately

```
python PlayerVsPlayer.py
python PlayerVsComputed.py
python OnlineGame.py
```
